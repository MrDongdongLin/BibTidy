abstract={Position scrambling (permutation) is widely used in multimedia encryption schemes and some international encryption standards, such as the Data Encryption Standard and the Advanced Encryption Standard. In this article, the authors re-evaluate the security of a typical image-scrambling encryption algorithm (ISEA). Using the internal correlation remaining in the cipher image, they disclose important visual information of the corresponding plain image in a ciphertext-only attack scenario. Furthermore, they found that the real scrambling domain - the position-scrambling scope of ISEA's scrambled elements - can be used to support an efficient known or chosen-plaintext attack on it. Detailed experimental results have verified these points and demonstrate that some advanced multimedia processing techniques can facilitate the cryptanalysis of multimedia encryption algorithms.},

abstract={The human vision system usually has a specifically activated area of neurons when recognizing a category of images. Inspired by this visual mechanism, we propose a layerwise class-aware convolutional neural network architecture to explicitly discover category-tailored neurons on intermediate hidden layers to improve the network learning ability. Instead of directly selecting activated neurons for different categories, we inversely suppress those neurons of intermediate layers irrelevant with the given target class to produce a class-specific subnetwork, which implicitly enhances the discriminability of hidden layer features due to the increase of the inter-class discrepancy on them. Together with the classifier of the top layer, we jointly learn this network by formulating the suppressor of hidden layers as a penalty term in the objective function. To address class-specific neuron suppression in each hidden layer, we also introduce a statistic method based on mutual information to dynamically and automatically update the suppressed neurons during the network training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to the state-of-the-art models.},

abstract={In this paper, a new learning method is proposed for human motion data analysis. In order to train motion data by the method of multiple instance learning, each human joint's motion clip is regarded as a bag, while each of its segments is regarded as an instance. Due to high dimensionality of motion's features, Isomap nonlinear dimensionality reduction is used. An algorithmic framework is used to approximate the optimal mapping function by a radial basis function (RBF) neural network for handling new data. Then data driven decision trees based on multiple instance are automatically constructed to reflect the influence of each point during the comparison of motion similarity. Some experimental examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

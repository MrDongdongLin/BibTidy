Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel distributed compressed sensing based
   joint detection and tracking algorithm for multistatic radar system,
   which significantly reduces the computational load in a centralized
   fusion framework. For different receivers in the multi static radar
   system, their corresponding sparse vectors, which are represented in
   state space, share the same locations of nonzero reflection
   coefficients. This fits the joint sparsity model 2 (JSM-2) in
   distributed compressed sensing. In this paper, a novel algorithm, named
   distributed general similar sensing matrix pursuit (DGSSMP) algorithm,
   is proposed to tackle the generalized JSM-2 model when each individual
   sensing matrix is different and with high coherence. In contrast to the
   classical greedy algorithms dealing with single subspace, the proposed
   DGSSMP algorithm has to tackle a union of different subspaces, with each
   subspace corresponding to a different sensing matrix for each individual
   receiver. The simulation results show that in the proposed distributed
   compressed sensing based joint detection and tracking framework, the
   proposed DGSSMP algorithm together with the track before detect (TBD)
   scheme can effectively distinguish true targets from clutter based on
   the information from multiple scans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{We derive a parallel alternating direction method of multipliers (PADMM)
   and apply it to compound l(1)-regularized imaging inverse problems. The
   proposed method is capable of locating the saddle point of large-scale
   convex minimization problems with the sum of several nonsmooth but
   proximable terms. Using an operator splitting strategy, the objective is
   decomposed into subproblems that are conveniently, individually and
   simultaneously solved. With the assistance of the Moreau decomposition,
   our method excludes auxiliary variables that exist in the ADMM and
   possesses a compacter structure. Thus, the proposed method is preferable
   in distributed computation. The convergence proof and convergence rate
   analysis are presented. Application to both image restoration and image
   compressed sensing demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the
   proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   variation on compressive sensing}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Abstract = {{In order to attain better reconstruction quality from compressive
   sensing (CS) of images, exploitation of the dependency or correlation
   patterns among the transform coefficients commonly has been employed. In
   this paper, we study a new image sensing technique, called compressive
   image sensing (CIS), with computational complexity O(m(2)), where m
   denotes the length of a measurement vector y = phi x, which is sampled
   from the signal x of length n via the sampling matrix phi with
   dimensionality m x n. CIS is basically a variation on compressive
   sampling.
   The contributions of CIS include: (i) reconstruction speed is extremely
   fast due to a closed-form solution being derived; (ii) certain
   reconstruction accuracy is preserved because significant components of x
   can be reconstructed with higher priority via an elaborately designed
   phi; and (iii) in addition to conventional 1D sensing, we also study 2D
   separate sensing to enable simultaneous acquisition and compression of
   large-sized images. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is beneficial for both hospitals and patients to accelerate MRI
   scanning. Recently, a new fast MRI technique based on CS was proposed.
   However, the reconstruction quality and computation time of CS-MRI did
   not meet the standard of clinical use. Therefore, we proposed a novel
   algorithm based on three successful components: the sparsity of EWT, the
   rapidness of FISTA, and the excellent tuning in SISTA. The proposed
   method was dubbed Exponential Wavelet Iterative Shrinkage/Threshold
   Algorithm (EWISTA). Experiments over four kinds of MR images (brain,
   ankle, knee, and ADHD) indicated that the proposed EWISTA showed better
   reconstruction performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms such as
   FCSA, ISTA, FISTA, SISTA, and EWT-ISTA. Moreover, EWISTA was faster than
   ISTA and EVVT-ISTA, but slightly slower than FCSA, FISTA and SISTA. (C)

Abstract = {{Creating a proper dictionary is an essential step in sparse signal
   recovery to explore sparsity in a variety of applications. To utilize
   the sparse property of the signal of interest, a large and fine
   dictionary is usually desired to achieve high estimation accuracy.
   Unfortunately, a big dictionary requires high computational complexity.
   Furthermore, one can imagine that no matter how fine we grid the domain
   to create the dictionary, there will always be an off-grid problem,
   namely the parameters to be estimated do not lie on the grids. This
   off-grid problem is the so-called a basis mismatch, which will degrade
   the estimation performance and it can be formulated as the
   multiplicative noise to the unknown parameters or quantization error to
   the dictionary. To tackle this issue, in this paper, robust algorithms
   are developed to enhance the estimation accuracy by utilizing the robust
   optimization techniques such as stochastic robust and worst case
   optimizations. As a result, an extra l(2)-norm constraint on parameter
   of interest is introduced to increase the estimation robustness. In
   addition, both theoretical analysis and simulations show that the
   proposed robust sparsity recovery approaches are superior in performance
   to other recovery schemes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Bayesian signal detection with compressed measurements}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{289}},
Pages = {{241-253}},
Month = {{DEC 24}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes the Bayesian approach to signal detection in
   compressed sensing (CS) using compressed measurements directly. A
   general expression of the probability of error is obtained where the
   prior probabilities of hypotheses could be equal or unequal and the
   additive noise is assumed to be uncorrelated Gaussian noise with
   possibly unequal variances. Upper and lower bounds of the probability of
   error are also derived using the restricted isometry property (RIP)
   constant and then the more computationally feasible mutual coherence of
   a given sampling matrix in CS. When the difference between the prior
   probabilities is sufficiently small and the signal to noise ratio is
   relatively large, an approximate but simpler expression of the
   probability of error is obtained. Furthermore, a new bound of the
   probability of error is derived in terms of a piecewise function.
   Numerical simulations are also provided to illustrate the new
   theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Compressed sensing (CS) has stirred great interests in many fields of
   science, due to its ability to capture most information of compressible
   signals at a rate significantly below the Nyquist rate. Reconstructing
   the signal from random measurements is an important topic in CS. In this
   paper, a new algorithm Incomplete variables Truncated Conjugate Gradient
   method (ITCG) is proposed to reconstruct the signal by solving a
   programming with l(1) norm. By adjusting the parameters of ITCG, two
   specific algorithms are presented, i.e. ITCG-vs for very sparse
   reconstruction and ITCG-nvs for not very sparse reconstruction. To make
   full use of the sparse nature of signals, ITCG can reconstruct them
   efficiently. The experiments show that the two algorithms of ITCG
   (especially ITCG-nvs) are much faster than competing methods in sparse
   reconstruction. In addition, it has been shown that ITCG-vs can converge
   after finite iterations under some decent conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier
